## About the Project

**Multi-Step Form Project** Multi-Step Form Project is a web application designed to collect user information through a multi-step form, ensuring data is accurately entered before submission. This project was developed using React.js, Formik, and Yup, with the primary goal of simplifying the user data collection process across multiple form steps and providing a review before submission.

### Key Objectives:

- Improve User Experience: By dividing form input into manageable steps, users can focus on one section at a time, making the process less overwhelming.
- Data Validation: Each step utilizes Formik and Yup for real-time validation, ensuring that users provide accurate information before proceeding.
- Local Storage Utilization: The application leverages the browser's local storage to temporarily save user data throughout the multi-step form process. This ensures that users can navigate between steps without losing their progress. Upon final submission, the collected data is stored persistently, enabling easy retrieval and verification. This feature enhances user convenience, making it suitable for users who may need to complete the form at their own pace.

## Features

- Form validation: Each step includes validation to ensure all required fields are filled in correctly.
- Data persistence: User data is saved to localStorage upon form submission.
- Responsive Design: The form layout is fully responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.
- Dark Mode Support: The project includes light/dark mode based on user preference.
